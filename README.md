**Find your quantum vulnerabilities before attackers do.**

QuantumSafe is a post-quantum security platform that covers the full arc — the
attack, the detection, and the fix:

1. **The attack** — a **quantum-computing module** ([`quantum/`](quantum/)) that
   *implements the real attacks*: **Shor's** and **Grover's** algorithms in
   Qiskit, run on a quantum simulator (Shor factors a number and reconstructs an
   RSA key).
2. **The detection** — a **static-analysis engine** that scans codebases across
   11 languages for cryptography quantum computers will break, scores the risk,
   and generates a NIST-aligned migration plan. Measured at **100% precision/
   recall** on a labeled [benchmark](benchmark/).
3. **The fix** — a **post-quantum module** ([`pqc/`](pqc/)) that implements the
   recommended quantum-safe replacement from scratch: a lattice-based (LWE) key
   exchange, the math behind CRYSTALS-Kyber / ML-KEM.

So it doesn't just *name* the problem — it demonstrates the attack, finds the
vulnerable code, and runs the solution.

It ships as three parts that share **one** detection engine:

- A **free CLI** (`pip install quantumsafe`) that scans local directories or
  public GitHub repos and prints/exports findings.
- A **Flask REST API** that powers the dashboard, ingests scans, and handles
  auth + billing.
- A **dark, Bloomberg-terminal-style web dashboard** with scan history,
  findings, migration plans, exports, and Stripe-powered subscriptions.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** QuantumSafe is a security-awareness tool. It uses static
> pattern + AST analysis and is **not** a substitute for a professional
> cryptographic audit. Findings are heuristic and may include false
> positives/negatives.

## What this project demonstrates

QuantumSafe is a full, working product built end to end — not a tutorial clone.
It was built to show breadth and depth across the stack:

- **Quantum computing:** real implementations of **Shor's algorithm** (quantum
  order-finding + phase estimation, which factors a number and recovers an RSA
  key) and **Grover's algorithm** in **Qiskit**, run on a quantum simulator —
  see [`quantum/`](quantum/). Not described — executed.
- **Post-quantum cryptography from scratch:** a lattice-based (LWE) key
  encapsulation mechanism — the foundation of NIST's ML-KEM/Kyber — implemented
  and verified over 200+ key exchanges with zero failures ([`pqc/`](pqc/)).
- **Program analysis:** a real detection engine using Python's `ast` module
  (import + call resolution) alongside a multi-language regex engine, with
  per-line/per-family de-duplication so findings don't double-count.
- **Applied cryptography knowledge:** maps each finding to *why* it's quantum-
  vulnerable (Shor's vs. Grover's algorithm) and to the correct NIST PQC
  replacement (FIPS 203/204/205).
- **Backend engineering:** a Flask REST API with SQLAlchemy, JWT + bcrypt auth,
  hashed API keys, rate limiting, CORS lockdown, and Stripe subscription billing.
- **Frontend engineering:** a dependency-light dashboard (vanilla JS) with a
  consistent data contract against the API, charts, and exports.
- **Measured, not asserted:** a labeled [benchmark](benchmark/) (with comment and
  word-boundary decoys) reports the detector's **precision/recall**, and the
  result is enforced by the test suite.
- **Software engineering practice:** one shared detection package powering both
  the CLI and the API, 55 automated tests, CI, and deploy configs for a real
  multi-service deployment.

See [TECHNICAL_OVERVIEW.md](TECHNICAL_OVERVIEW.md) for the design decisions, the
quantum-threat background, and an honest list of limitations.

## The threat — why this matters now

RSA-2048 and elliptic-curve crypto secure almost everything: HTTPS/TLS,
certificates, SSH, code signing, VPNs. **Shor's algorithm breaks all of it** —
the math is settled; what's missing is hardware (it needs millions of
error-corrected qubits, and today's machines have a few hundred noisy ones).

That gap is the whole point, not a reason to wait:

- **"Harvest now, decrypt later":** an attacker can record your encrypted traffic
  today and decrypt it once the hardware exists. Anything that must stay secret
  for 5–15 years is effectively at risk *now*.
- **Migration is slow:** swapping cryptography across a large codebase takes years,
  which is why NIST finalized the post-quantum standards (FIPS 203/204/205) in
  2024 — so teams can start *before* the break is possible.

QuantumSafe exists to make that migration tractable: **find** the vulnerable
crypto (scanner), **understand** why it's vulnerable (Shor/Grover demos), and
**adopt** the quantum-safe replacement (LWE/Kyber implementation).

## What it detects

Across **Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, Go, Ruby, C#, PHP, Rust, C/C++,
Kotlin, and Swift** (Python also via AST for precision):

| Risk | Algorithms |
|------|------------|
| **HIGH** — migrate immediately | RSA (any size, incl. RSA-2048/4096), ECDSA / ECDH / ECC, DSA, Diffie-Hellman, MD5, SHA-1 |
| **MEDIUM** — plan migration | TLS 1.0 / 1.1, 3DES / Triple DES, RC4, RSA key sizes under 2048 |
| **LOW** — monitor | SHA-256, AES-128, TLS 1.2 |

Each finding includes the file, line number, algorithm, risk level, *why* it is
vulnerable, and a NIST-approved replacement:

- RSA/ECC key exchange → **CRYSTALS-Kyber (ML-KEM, FIPS 203)**
- RSA/ECDSA/DSA signatures → **CRYSTALS-Dilithium (ML-DSA, FIPS 204)** / SPHINCS+ (FIPS 205)
- Hash functions → **SHA-3** or SHA-256
- Symmetric encryption → **AES-256**

## Quantum Risk Score

A 0–100 score computed **from real findings** (never hardcoded):

```
score = min(100, 15*HIGH + 5*MEDIUM + 1*LOW)
```

| Score | Band | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| 0–30 | Low | Good quantum hygiene |
| 31–60 | Medium | Plan migration |
| 61–80 | High | Prioritize migration |
| 81–100 | Critical | Immediate action required |

---

## Evaluation (does the detector actually work?)

The scanner is measured against a labeled [benchmark](benchmark/) of 12 files
across 9 languages, including decoys (crypto names in comments, word-boundary
traps like `md5sumLabel`) designed to trip a naive matcher:

```bash
python benchmark/evaluate.py
```

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Labeled findings | 24 |
| Precision | 100% |
| Recall | 100% |

`evaluate.py` prints the exact false positives/negatives so the numbers are
auditable, and the thresholds are enforced by `tests/test_benchmark.py`. Honest
limits (inline comments, string literals, regex-only for non-Python) are
documented in [benchmark/README.md](benchmark/README.md) — this is a regression
benchmark, not a claim of perfection on arbitrary code.

## Quantum demonstrations (Shor & Grover)

The [`quantum/`](quantum/) module runs the real algorithms on a quantum simulator:

```bash
pip install -r quantum/requirements.txt
python quantum/shor.py     # quantum order-finding factors N=15, then breaks a toy RSA key
python quantum/grover.py   # recovers a hidden k-bit key in ~sqrt(2^k) steps
```

- **`shor.py`** uses quantum phase estimation over modular exponentiation to find
  the order of `a mod N`, factors `N`, and reconstructs an RSA private key from
  the factors — the concrete reason RSA/ECC are rated **HIGH**.
- **`grover.py`** uses amplitude amplification to search a key space in ~√N
  queries, halving effective key strength — the reason AES-128/SHA-256 are **LOW**
  (keep the primitive, double the size).

Honest scope: these run at small scale (factoring 15), which is the genuine state
of the art for end-to-end Shor — RSA-2048 needs millions of error-corrected
qubits that don't exist yet. That gap is exactly why migrating *now* matters. See
[quantum/README.md](quantum/README.md) for the math and the real-hardware path.

## Post-quantum solution ([`pqc/`](pqc/))

The scanner recommends Kyber/ML-KEM; this module implements its lattice (LWE)
foundation from scratch and runs a real quantum-safe key exchange:

```bash
pip install -r pqc/requirements.txt
python pqc/lwe_kem.py     # Alice & Bob agree on a shared secret; an eavesdropper can't
```

Why a quantum computer can't break it: LWE has **no periodic structure** for
Shor's algorithm to exploit (unlike RSA/ECC). See [pqc/README.md](pqc/README.md)
for the math and honest scope.

## CLI: install & usage

```bash
pip install quantumsafe        # from PyPI once published
# or, from this repo:
pip install -e .
```

### Commands

```bash
# Scan a local directory (colored terminal table)
quantumsafe scan --path ./myproject

# Scan a public GitHub repo (shallow-cloned to a temp dir, then cleaned up)
quantumsafe scan --repo https://github.com/org/app

# Write a report: JSON, HTML, SARIF, CycloneDX CBOM, or an SVG risk badge
quantumsafe scan --path ./myproject --output report.json
quantumsafe scan --path ./myproject --output report.html
quantumsafe scan --path ./myproject --output report.sarif       # GitHub code scanning
quantumsafe scan --path ./myproject --output report.cbom.json   # CycloneDX CBOM
quantumsafe scan --path ./myproject --output badge.svg          # embeddable risk badge

# Skip paths with glob patterns (repeatable)
quantumsafe scan --path . --exclude 'tests/*' --exclude 'vendor/*'

# Fail the process (exit 1) if any HIGH finding exists — handy in CI
quantumsafe scan --path . --fail-on-high

# Try it on the bundled examples
quantumsafe scan --path examples

# Link the CLI to your paid dashboard account (key from Settings page)
quantumsafe auth --key qs_live_xxxxxxxx

# Version
quantumsafe version
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--path` | Local directory or file to scan |
| `--repo` | Public `https://github.com/<org>/<repo>` URL |
| `--output` | Write to `.json`, `.cbom.json` (CycloneDX CBOM), `.html`, `.sarif`, or `.svg` (risk badge); terminal summary still printed |
| `--exclude` | Glob of paths to skip (repeatable) |
| `--fail-on-high` | Exit non-zero on any HIGH finding (CI gate) |

**Suppressing a finding:** add `# quantumsafe: ignore` (any comment style) to the
line. Useful for a known-safe, non-security use of an algorithm.

### Use in CI (GitHub Action)

QuantumSafe ships a reusable action that scans and uploads results to your
repo's **Security tab**:

```yaml
- uses: Danny-397/Quantamn-Safe@main
  with:
    path: .
    exclude: tests/*,vendor/*
    fail-on-high: "true"
- uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
  with:
    sarif_file: quantumsafe.sarif
```

## Dashboard

A static site (`frontend/`) — no build step. Pages:

- **Landing** — hero, feature pillars, pricing (Free / Pro $19 / Team $49).
- **Auth** — login, register, forgot/reset password.
- **Dashboard** — Overview (risk score, totals, trend chart, recent scans),
  Scans (paginated), Findings (filterable), Settings (API key + account),
  Billing (upgrade / Stripe portal).
- **Scan detail** — full findings table, filter by risk, export JSON/HTML/CSV.
- **Migration plan** — findings grouped by risk with NIST replacement,
  standard reference, and estimated complexity.

Point the dashboard at your API by editing one line in `frontend/config.js`:

```js
window.QUANTUMSAFE_API = "https://quantumsafe-api.onrender.com";
```

(Leave it `""` for local development — it falls back to `http://localhost:5000`.)

---

## Local development setup

Requires Python 3.9+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Danny-397/Quantamn-Safe
cd Quantamn-Safe

# 1) Install the shared scanner package (CLI) in editable mode
pip install -e .

# 2) Install backend dependencies
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

# 3) Configure environment
cp .env.example .env          # fill in SECRET_KEY / JWT_SECRET_KEY at minimum

# 4) Run the API (creates SQLite tables automatically)
cd backend
python app.py                 # http://localhost:5000  (health: /health)

# 5) Serve the dashboard (any static server)
cd ../frontend
python -m http.server 3000    # http://localhost:3000
```

### Run the whole stack with Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
# Dashboard -> http://localhost:3000   API -> http://localhost:5000
```

### Tests

Run the test suite (scanner, scorer, recommender, full API; uses an in-memory
DB, no setup):

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest -q
```

Seed a demo account so the dashboard is populated:

```bash
cd backend && python seed_demo.py     # demo@quantumsafe.dev / demodemo123
```

Without `MAIL_SERVER` configured, verification/reset emails are printed to the
server log instead of being sent — so you can develop without SMTP.

## Deployment

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/Danny-397/Quantamn-Safe)

See **[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)** for a full step-by-step walkthrough
(Render + Vercel + Stripe + demo seeding). In short:

- **CLI → PyPI:** `python -m build && twine upload dist/*`
- **Backend → Render:** push the repo; Render reads [`render.yaml`](render.yaml)
  (web service + Postgres). Set the `sync: false` env vars in the dashboard.
  Add a Stripe webhook pointing at `https://<api>/api/v1/billing/webhook`.
- **Frontend → Vercel:** import the repo; [`vercel.json`](vercel.json) serves
  `frontend/` statically. Set `window.QUANTUMSAFE_API` to your Render API URL.
- **Database → Render Postgres** (provisioned by `render.yaml`).
